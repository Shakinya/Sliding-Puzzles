# Sliding-Puzzles

# Sliding Puzzles Solver 🧩

A Java-based application to simulate or solve sliding puzzle problems. This project allows you to parse puzzle inputs, apply algorithmic logic, and observe how puzzles are solved or analyzed.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on implementing sliding puzzle logic in Java. It includes:

- Parsing puzzle data
- Choosing algorithms to process puzzles
- Handling and analyzing outcomes
- Includes a report explaining the logic used

---

## ✨ Features

- 📥 Input parsing using a custom parser
- 🧠 Algorithm selection and execution
- 🖥️ Console-based output and progress
- 📄 Includes a PDF (`Shai_Algo.pdf`) with algorithm explanation
- 🧪 Organized as an IntelliJ IDEA project for easy development
