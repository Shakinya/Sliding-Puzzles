# 🧩 Sliding Puzzle Solver – Algorithm Design Project

This is a Java-based project developed for solving sliding puzzles (e.g., 8-puzzle, 15-puzzle). It demonstrates the use of algorithmic strategies, particularly search algorithms, to efficiently find the solution path in a classic tile-based problem.
